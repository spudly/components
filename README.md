# @spudly/sandbox

A springboard for creating npm packages. Packages created here should eventually
make their way into individual repositories & the npm registry.

# TODOs

- 100% test coverage
- README.md file in root + each package
- build badge
- coverage badge
- changelog
- conventional commits + semantic-release?
- published storybook link
- add more components:

  - LiveDiffMonaco
  - Slide
